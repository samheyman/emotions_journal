# Decisions

## Week 7

Decided to use Svelte and PWA
Decided to use localstorage for now (can update to indexDB later)

## Week 8

Data import/export
Good to add .md as export format (for Notion, Obsidian, Bear, sharing with a therapist etc.) but not needed for import (too hard to handle). Data export in .json is for backup purpose.

- Export JSON — for backup / import later
- Export Markdown — for reading / sharing (import not supported)
