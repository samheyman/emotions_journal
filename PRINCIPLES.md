# Lumidian — Principles & Rationale

The features in Lumidian are grounded in neuroscience and somatic psychology research. This document captures the core ideas that shape what the app does and why.

## 1. Externalising emotion calms the amygdala

Writing about an emotion — getting it out of your head and onto paper (or into an app) — creates psychological distance from the experience. This process is known to reduce activity in the amygdala, the brain's threat-detection centre. When an emotion is externalised it is no longer held entirely in working memory; the cognitive load drops and the nervous system has space to settle.

**In Lumidian:** the check-in form prompts you to name and record what you are feeling. The act of doing so is itself the regulation — not just the data you produce.

## 2. Labelling reduces emotional intensity

Research by Matthew Lieberman and colleagues (UCLA) shows that putting a feeling into words — *affect labelling* — measurably reduces the subjective intensity of that emotion. Naming what is happening shifts processing from the reactive limbic system toward the prefrontal cortex, where reflection and choice live.

**In Lumidian:** the emotion vocabulary in check-ins is deliberately granular. The more precisely you can name what you feel, the greater the regulating effect.

## 3. The six basic emotions as a foundation

Paul Ekman's model identifies six universal basic emotions — Happiness, Sadness, Disgust, Anger, Fear, and Surprise — as cross-cultural building blocks of emotional experience. Being in touch with these foundational states brings clarity to actions, enriches relationships, and supports living in alignment with personal values.

**In Lumidian:** the valence and energy axes, combined with the emotion tags, are designed to capture both the broad shape of a feeling and its specific quality.

## 4. Interoception — sensing the body's internal state

Interoception is the ability to perceive internal bodily signals: heartbeat, breathing, hunger, muscle tension, temperature. For someone who is dysregulated, these signals can feel chaotic or mysterious. Making them visible and nameable transforms an overwhelming bodily experience into something understandable and manageable.

**In Lumidian:** the body sensation and energy fields in the check-in invite attention to physical state, not just cognitive interpretation. This is the starting point for nervous system regulation.

## 5. Somatic journaling — writing from the body

Somatic journaling is a body-centred therapeutic writing practice that focuses on physical sensations rather than mental narratives. By tuning into and recording sensations (tightness, warmth, tension, heaviness) rather than stories about what happened, it fosters self-awareness, emotional processing, and nervous system regulation. It draws attention out of rumination and into embodied presence.

**In Lumidian:** the note field and body-anchor prompts support this practice. The goal is not to analyse but to observe and describe — what sensations are present right now?

## 6. Reframing after noticing a negative emotion

Once a difficult emotion has been noticed and named, there is an opportunity to reframe it — to find an alternative interpretation or context that reduces its grip. This is not denial; it is a deliberate cognitive shift that changes the emotional impact of an experience without suppressing it.

**In Lumidian:** the check-in flow is sequenced so that you name the emotion first (steps 1–2) before the note field invites reflection (step 3). This ordering is intentional: you have to see it before you can work with it.

## Design implications

These principles shape several concrete decisions in the app:

- **Friction is low for logging, higher for reviewing.** The check-in should feel effortless so the habit forms. Analysis (Trends) is a separate, optional step.
- **No judgement language.** Labels are descriptive, not evaluative. There are no "good" or "bad" emotions.
- **Private by default.** All data lives on device. Sharing is always opt-in. Emotional honesty requires safety.
- **Calm, minimal aesthetic.** The visual tone is intentionally muted and serious — in keeping with the depth of the practice, not a gamified productivity app.
